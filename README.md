# Basic-arithmetic-with-big-numbers

The four programs that are part of this project supports only integer positive numbers and their behaviour with values different than that is not defined.

You can make any of the programs work in two ways:
- Giving as arguments 2 numbers greater or equal zero separated by a spece. (e.g. ./longAddition 3000000000 400000000000000)
- Giving as arguments a pair of these: name of a plain text file, the number of digits to take from this file separated by a space. (e.g ./longDivision M82589933.txt 10 M82589933.txt 2).The names of the files, of course, can be different.
